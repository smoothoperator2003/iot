- LED-Matrix Display:
  - Display device containing aligned light emitting diodes (LEDs) in matrix form.
  - Used for displaying symbols, graphics, characters, alphabets, numerals.
  - Available in various dimensions: 5x7, 8x8, 16x8, 128x16, 128x32, 128x64.
  - Different colors: Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Orange, White.

- Construction:
  - LEDs are wired together in rows and columns.
  - Minimizes the number of pins required to drive them.
  - Matrix pattern made in row anode-column cathode or row cathode-column anode pattern.

- Row Anode-Column Cathode Pattern:
  - Entire row serves as anode.
  - All columns serve as cathode.

- Row Cathode-Column Anode Pattern:
  - Vice versa of row anode-column cathode pattern.
