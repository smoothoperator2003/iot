- LED (Light Emitting Diode):
  - Semiconductor device emitting light with current flow.
  - Commonly used in electronics for indicators, displays, or light sources.
  - Available in various colors and sizes.
  - Polarized with positive (anode) and negative (cathode) leads.

- Resistor:
  - Passive electronic component.
  - Designed to limit/control electrical current in circuits.
  - Provides resistance to electron flow.
  - Used for adjusting voltage, limiting current, and protecting components.

- Connecting Wires:
  - Also known as jumper wires.
  - Establish electrical connections between components/devices.
  - Available in various lengths and colors.
  - Facilitate organization on breadboards or PCBs.

- Breadboard:
  - Reusable solderless prototyping board.
  - Creates temporary electrical connections.
  - Consists of interconnected metal strips and holes.
  - Allows quick and easy experimentation without soldering.
  - Components can be easily rearranged during design and testing.

        print('LED ON')
        time.sleep(1)
        GPIO.output(22, False)
        print('LED OFF')
        time.sleep(1)
finally:
    GPIO.output(22, False)
    GPIO.cleanup()
time.sleep(1)
GPIO.setup(25, GPIO.LOW)
time.sleep(1)
